                                        <p class="text-justify">I faced the early symptoms such as vomiting,
                                        fever so he thought it was a general health disturbance and he went
                                        to a nearby doctor, took medicines but neither his vomiting could
                                        be stopped nor the fever was controlled. Through social media, I
                                        heard about B. K Arogyam and after searching it on YouTube and
                                        seeing the videos and after been satisfied, he called us. I
                                        came to BK Arogyam that time my Creatinine level was 19 and
                                        I immediately admitted there as I was on stage 3 of CKD then
                                        I underwent the process of kidney regeneration and now my
                                        dialysis is stopped and my Creatinine level is also not increasing
                                        and gradually started to reduce.  Now I am healthy, I can eat whatever
                                           I wish and can live my life to the fullest.</p>

                                        facing severe symptoms like swelling in feet, pain during urination,
                                        color-changing of urine, extreme weakness, etc. When I heard about a
                                        homeopathy treatment, I went for it but the Creatinine level increased
                                        to above 14. I went to BK Arogyam, admitted immediately. My case was
                                        critical but when our Ayurvedic treatment, medicine, and utmost care
                                        is taken at Arogyam center my Creatinine level reduced to 12, without
                                           having dialysis. Now I am very happy and satisfied.</p>

                                        allopathic treatment and getting no relief, after getting information about
                                        B. K Arogyam through social media, I decided to get a checkup from them.
                                        Just after taking the treatment for 10 days, the Creatinine level reduced
                                        from 2.6 to 2.4 and after a month the Creatinine level was reduced to 1.6
                                        and after three months Creatinine level reduced to 1.07, which is considered
                                        as a normal Creatinine level, now I am healthy, happy and satisfied from
